**Name**: EcoLearn


**Description**: EcoLearn is designed to help make the challenges of sustainable living engaging, rewarding, and social. Inspired by the gamified learning model of Duolingo, it transforms eco-friendly actions into daily challenges that feel more like a game than a chore. Instead of memorizing vocabulary, users “level up” by practicing real-world habits that reduce waste, save energy, and promote sustainable choices. 


**How to use**: Open the website and create an account to save data. To scan, simply open the scan section and scan whatever items you want one at a time or upload an image.
